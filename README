SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
	relink is a simple utility that modifies your symlinks
	FILE in a selected manner:

	*	Change linking to relative path, do not follow
		links.

	*	Change linking to absolute path, do not follow
		links.

	*	Change linking to relative path, follow links.

	*	Change linking to absolute path, follow links.

	*	Change into hardlink.

	*	Remove link but duplicate target.

	If FILE is omitted, the file list will be read from stdin.

	--help
		Print help information.

	--copyright
		Print copyright information.

	--warranty

	--version
		Print program name and version.

	--relative

	--absolute
		Link to absolute path.

	--symlink
		Keep as symbolic link. (default)

	--hardlink
		Change into hardlink.

	--duplicate
		Duplicate target instead of linking.
